# Sizzler

This is the repo for Sizzler: SequentIal fuZZing in LaddER diagrams for vulnerability detection in Programmable Logic Controllers. Sizzler is a modified version based on AFL-2.57b. Sizzler is solely concerned with the analysis of executed ladder logic and implements a novel mutation strategy enhanced by a Sequential Generative Adversarial Network (Seq-GAN) formulation and user within a fuzzing process. 

# Requirement

```bash
PyTorch

Python 3.6

CUDA at least 8.0
```

This document provides guidance on how to conduct fuzzing to test software for vulnerabilities. Fuzzing is a technique for discovering errors or vulnerabilities in computer software by generating large amounts of random input data.
